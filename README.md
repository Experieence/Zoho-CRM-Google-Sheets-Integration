# Zoho-CRM-Google-Sheets-Integration
This project integrates Zoho CRM with Google Sheets using Zoho Flow to automate the transfer of contact information. When a new contact is created in Zoho CRM, their details are automatically synced with a Google Sheets document, reducing manual data entry and improving efficiency in managing contact data.
